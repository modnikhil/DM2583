before i begin id just like point out that i am not reviewing this film as a work of art    on that score it seems just as good as most films if not at least a little better    but as a work of propaganda   i will also try to avoid the mistake made by 99 of the customer reviewers on amazon who think they have to recount the plot blow by blow in excruciating detail and often erroneous detail even though a hundred other reviewers have already done so and even though there is already a much better more consice and more accuarate editorial review at the top of every product page      a couple of years before 911 tom clancy wrote a novel the sum of all fears about a group of islamic extremist terrorists who are planning to set off a nuclear device in america   when hollywood turned this film into a movie also before 911 they decided that it was much more plausible and responsible to make the bad guys white supremacist neo nazis   golly and they wonder why the rest of the country views most people in the entertainment industry as knee jerk liberals  i saw the siege when it first came out in theaters and have recently viewed it again on television and it seems even worse now than when i first saw it because of 911   at the time i saw the movie i thought that it presented an implausible and unrealistic scenario regarding americas reaction to such a terrorist threat but i did think they were presenting a plausible and realistic scenario regarding that terrorist threat   when 911 happened i was shocked and outraged but i was also not surprised   an open and free society such as ours has always been vulnerable to such attacks and always will be    and so we still are   the only thing that surprised me is that it has taken the terrorists so long to figure it out and sometimes i think they still dont realize their potential   not all arabs are muslims but most profess to be   not all muslims are extremists or terrorists but a very few are   and all of the terrorists who caused 911 were   if the siege is any indication hollywood apparently thinks most of the unwashed masses in flyover country dont know this   hollywood apparently thinks that most americans or at least most white americans are racist sexist stupid and evil   hollywood apparently thinks that america is more at fault for terrorism than the extremists   hollywood apparently thinks that it is unacceptable to point out that there are more than a few people in the arab and muslim communities who hold negatively stereotypical views of america christians israel jews etc  and that the extremists use those stereotypes to justify their terrorism   this is where the siege fails   after the worst terror incident in the film    a truck bomb kills six hundred people in the building which houses the nyc fbi headquarters effectively wiping out its anti terroism agency    having an army division occupy brooklyn and declare martial law while they screen two thousand recent arab immigrants that fit the profile of the twenty terrorists they are looking for hardly seems all that unreasonable   in fact the two star generals rationale for this approach is quite logical   but of course this is hollywood so this two star general just has to be some sort of bigoted homicidal maniac who wraps himself in the flag and despises his president and the constitution   after all the only unacceptable government spending is on defense and the only acceptable time to use the military is when we can guarantee that our country could not possibly benefit in any way from it    anything less than perfect altruism is absolute corruption   and naturally the military then proceeds to run amok in brooklyn torturing and murdering the innocent with impunity all the while condemning any critics for daring to question their patriotism   funny isnt it how after five times as many people die on 911 a conservative republican president reacts with far far more restraint than the sieges bill clinton  sure there have been abuses but they have been the exception whereas the siege posits that they would be the rule   what this film and much of america and much of the world fail to understand is this  what osama bin laden al quaeda islamofascists and terrorist extremists hate about us is that we are not exactly like them   some palestinians like the nazis will not be happy until there are no more jews left breathing on the face of the earth   the islamofascists will not be happy until everyone on the planet who does not surrender to their particular interpretation of islam is dead   pulling out of palestine pulling out of iraq electing a liberal democrat to the american presidency will not put an end to it   in fact nothing will put an end to it   there will always be terrorism terrorists extremism extremists crime criminals etc   but as long as we choose idealism over reality we will only be giving them more power   remember it is their idealism that makes them so willing to kill and die for their cause      one final note remember that a work of fiction proves nothing   no work of fiction can prove anything   the writer is the god of his own fictional universe and he gets to set all of the rules so naturally what he writes ends up justifying his own point of view   imagine a presidential debate where only one candidate gets to speak    for both sides  this is the case with the siege with jack londons the iron heel and pretty much any and all books and films   so to call this film realistic or prophetic is patently absurd   still i recommend seeing it at least once whether you saw it before 911 or not   the one thing that this film does prove albeit unintentionally is that hollywood does make great propaganda

having been a fan of walt disney movies for years now i was extremely pleased to find that bambi was coming out on dvd  i instantly placed an order for it it arrived within a few weeks well before the projected due date and was in perfect condition  this film also contains so many special features if you enjoy seeing the works of animation you most certainly will enjoy this movie  it is filled with the poignant disney magic which we all remember but along with it comes a wonderful backstory to the coming about of bambi one of the disney movies which revolutionized the world of animation using the multiplane camera to further the realism effects obtained in bambi impressionistic backgrounds and realistic yet human animals round out just a few of the many interesting aspects of this 1942 classic disney film  a great addition to any disney lovers collection certainly a must have in my book

after screening about twenty minutes of this thing on my 60 inch plasma i realized the tv had been irretrievably compromised by having this filth routed through it so i had to lay my tv gently on the den floor and then smother it with a pillow   this movie should have been entitled revolting people who are not in the least bit funny   the movie is pathologically unfunny   it is so unfunny it is very hard to tell where the humor is supposed to lie   instead the movie is a bleak yarn about stand up comedians whose material is    supposed to be funny apparently judging by title and by the tittering of the comedy audiences in the movie who constitute a kind of living laugh track   but i cannot begin to fathom what is supposed to be funny about this material   if the guy from myspace big myspace logo in background clearly a product placement and the guy from craigslist got in a fight i wonder whod win   this is one of the jokes in the movie that is supposed to be funny   then james taylor features in the movie as a kind of commercial for himself to no purpose whatsoever   the only way i could make sense of this movie is as an anti comedy a movie that is supposed to be funny only because it is so completely unfunny   however this subtle type of humor is rarely intentionally perpetrated   but if you want some genuine anti comedy stand up material here it is  comedian gets up on stage comes tentatively to microphone uhh    hi   the um the scheduled comedian is stuck in traffic and he sent me over here to fill in for him till he gets here  looks nervous consults piece of paper says tremulously so uhhh    he emailed me some of his material and ill ask you to bear with me while i get through it the best i can    squints but its kind of hard to read   my printer is low on toner   i dont know if youve noticed but brother printers seem to eat toner   for a couple years i had an epson which somehow lasted a lot longer on a single toner cartridge    though i might have been using it on the low toner setting    im not quite sure   you know how you can set the printer through the computer to be in toner saver mode  i think i might have done that with that other one    i dont know why ive never bothered to do that with the printer i have now but umm    anyway lets get started on some of this material and hopefully we can work through about half of it before joe gets here   but consults watch since ive been talking i see about five minutes have elapsed and so id better go through the material at about one and a half times normal speed in order to catch up    but then that might not be very funny    on the other hand it might make it funnier    show of hands who out there thinks that speeding things up makes them funnier  cmon now    okay one    two    three    only three people  okay well i guess i could ask now who doesnt think speeding things up makes them funnier    but then i already know the answer dont i  i mean i could just subtract three from  the total number of people in the room    but then i suppose some people might not have an opinion one way or the other and so that approach might not work   cell phone rings oh    could you    could you excuse me a moment  ive gotta get this    hello  lowers voice to an anguished hissing whisper where are you      youre youre goddam right im filling in for you im onstage right now   thats right   right now   i am standing in front of the audience   hows it going  well its not going too well   because theyre not laughing   apatows movie on the other hand completely fails to accomplish anything in the humor or anti humor department   instead it just makes you grim grimmer than a holocaust documentary   grimmer than grey gardens

310 to yuma is a classis western with a powerful story   glenn ford and van heflin give their normal outstanding performance   i once again cannot believe the nerve of todays producers and directors thinking that they can improve on a classic with todays mediocre actors with their remakes   they did not learn anything from such disasters as all the kings men   i have no intention of seeing the remake of 310 to yuma i will stay with the original   they did not use computer enhancements and special effects when the original was made

one of the earliest and best horror films of our age  nosferatu stars max shreck as the horrific vampire nosferatu or count orlock  every single time that the vampire walked into the room towards harker i felt compelled to hide under a table or a safe area   this is the story of a young townsman named jonathan harker who is sent a business letter by a certain quotorlockquot whom harker simply knows as a rich count  so harker embarks on a long journey through mysterious mountainous woodsy and shrouded places to the counts ominous castle  the next events in this silent masterpiece are too terrifying to explain  the best horror film beside phantom of the opera and metropolis ever made in our early history  possibly even in our long century    are we ready for some serious discussion can we talk unfortunately countless bad prints both vhs and dvd have been made of nosferatu  the goodtimes video release has grainy image quality but is in the original black  white color format  it does not have a musical score    a tinted version by type o negative has pretty good image quality but a distracting soundtrack    blackhawk has produced a fairly credible dvd of this classic with fuzzy image quality but a classical music score    madacy has released an expensive dvd  the picture and sound quality also leave something to be desired    yet another vhs print was duplicated by timeless video  i own a vhs version of metropolis released by timeless video and found it to be better than i expected though the quality is shoddy compared to the kino video print    the kino dvd of nosferatu is the best on the market yet  the picture quality is fine and the soundtrack is suitable    this old horror classic is guaranteed to send a chill up your spine  so purchase the kino version today

a heart wrenching story of an unruly inmate jack nicholson trying to bring dignity to the lives of other inmates living in the same mental institution  however nurse ratchet is there to oppose him to make him think to stop the provocation   jack plays a likeable fellow and finds ways to do things like take them out of the institution for an afternoon boat ride  the authorities at the institution become sorely tired of his unruliness and the distress he causes but jacks influences have worn off  albeit too late for jack   the clever screen play provides laughs intended to provoke the establishment  a favorite pastime of the 1970s  the dialogue between inmates is excellent  cant be beat   this is an excellent movie with an extra dvd that includes many features

this is an excellent film in many ways   it is unique thought provoking and deals with unflinching honesty about one of the most important yet sloppily analysed facets of our modern liberal society drug addiction whether legal or illegal  pthere are many reasons why this is an important filmpfirstly the subject matter   drug addiction and its effect on all our lives   is intelligently and thoughtfully explored   not something one encounters often in films noawadays psecondly the production and direction are masterful   the director uses many innovative techniques to create emotions often outside of the cinematographic repertoire   the final half of the film feels as if you are in a mad dizzying rush forward as the film drives onwards to its harrowing emotional climax   it may not be the most subtle approach but it succeeds beyond doubt  pthirdly the film is not hindered by nostalgia it is brutally honest in how it thinks the protagonists would behave in real life and attains a strong degree of realism   the result of this is that the film is often harrowing and disturbing but never greatuitously   the viewer is not manipulated and treated in a condescending way as in so many films   this feels real pfourthly the performances are first rate   ellen burstyn in particular puts in a great turn as the doting mother with an inadverent addiction to slimming pills  pdarren aronofsky the director shows a uniquely compelling approach with serious subject matter   this is a film to watch and consider it will stay with you long after it has finished   altogether superior film making phugely recommended

the basic question is worth asking  start with a world of natural and synthetic bodies natural and synthetic thoughts and all combinations along both axes  what percentage of each does it take for some mind in some body to be humanpthe lead character is well placed to ask the question  she convincingly answers the question in her own case  the plot that carries her along is a man hunt in a futuristic urban landscape  for all its skyscrapers and other features the city still has its crowded streets banners and open store fronts  they are part of the answer functioning human communities in a man made physical environment pthe animation was uniformly good throughout but i found the script to have a choppy pace  there were long leisurely canal rides between the chases and shooting and long philosophical monologues  as long as the director chose an action movie for a vehicle i would have preferred to see the basic questions acted out rather than spoken pthis anime well done but the plot is too inconsistent for me to call it great  its a good one though and i keep coming back to it

i can see why this film was scorned back in the 70s  it is hard to sit down and watch this film without wondering if there is something wrong with you  the rape scenes are long brutal and unrelenting  what makes this film so tough to watch is the fact that the actress is raped not once twice three or four but five times worse the rape scenes make up the bulk of the movie so basically youre watching a woman being raped at length for what seems like most of the films running time  infamously roger ebert was moved to call this film vile garbage  still the film is brilliant in that it clearly uses shock to show how terrible rape is and how a woman suffers during the ordeal  but thats only part of the story  this is a rape revenge movie  so after the rape comes the revenge  most of the women who have championed this movie have praised the revenge section of the film  most men seem to hate the actress for taking her revenge to the umpteenth degree  violence definitely breeds more violence as the saying goes  and this film is very very violent  this is not family friendly entertainment  i personally think this film does have a positive message and that message is if a man takes away a womans right to control what happens to her body he could end up having a very bad day

a wonderfully crafted film  we love it  its visually beautiful with wonderful acting that is believable and real   i pause to make the comment about how anybody could give this film three stars  this is not contrived disney like dribble in the least  i actually gravitate toward foreign cinema because it is just exactly the opposite of american dribble  its just that people today are so negative they cant handle anything loving and good with out tearing it down because they are empty inside and have an attitude of if i am not happy no one else can be happy either   hmm sounds like selfishness and an over inflated sense of self   hey no wonder youre miserable   never the less        you grow to love the main characters and empathize with them   you know this film has something good ahead   its fun along the way   little bits of sunshine and happiness   the films core theme is true dont get so wrapped up in yourself and your troubles that you forget to tell the important people in your life i love you   the little french girl brilliant little actressin the film is in many ways a metaphor for a beautiful butterfly herself  or is the butterfly their friendship the grandfather figure and little girl  you know this film will end happily it has to but you just dont know exactly how   its like your going to get a gift but what  to the end your like whats going to happen  and the film keeps rewarding you again and again emotionally right up to fin   the world definitely needs more films like this gem  the same emotional flavor as my fathers glory and as worthy as kikijuro in its poignant little story and honest heart   as important to see as salaam bombay but for a much more brighter reason

this film is underrated by both regular movie goers and argetno fans usually it is panned because of how bizzare it is but the thing about an argento film is that he has never been good at writing a narrative   for him the important thing is to affect you emotionally and psychologically not in an intellectual way  this is probably his most bizzare and his most beautiful film  it is about a girl named jennifer corvinojennifer connelly who enrolls in a swiss boarding school and her classmates are being murdered by a mysterious killer  she has a gift of being able to communicate telepathically with insects and with the help of an entomologistdonald pleasence she tracks down the killer using her power  while i admit some of the narrative seems somewhat ridiculous it is a lush and beautiful film which has the feeling of a dream and jennifer connelly who has also starred in dark city and requiem for a dream is good enough in her first leading role  it also features a great musical score by goblin and bill wyman  it also features the directors wife daria nicolodi and his one of his daughters fiore argento  watch for her in the impressive and scary opening sequence  you will notice this film is similar in many ways to suspiria but it manages to stand on its own  in what other film will you see a monkey running wild with a razor blade

this is a very broad overview of pop and rock history up to 1980   this is pop history acording to baby boomers   the last 25 years of music are completely ignored   but all in all it was enjoyable to watch and the producers did well given the large topic and range of tastes   they really need to update this for the last 20 years   hip hop  grunge  electronic  harcore  boy bands

while most films that fall under the giallo banner are far more style than substance this one rises far above all of that   among dario argentos finest works it is an eerie psychological thriller which is part hitchcock part raymond chandler novel and part cinecitta   the story is believable and captivating the suspense is chilling the acting is superb   of course theres great music with ennio morricone at the helm of the sounds and of course theres all kinds of good looking people cool cars and stylish set pieces just as youd expect from an italian film from 1970   but with this film those extras are minor attractions and the film itself is what keeps you watching

csi is one of the best dramatic series in years  this compilation of the first season shows why   blessed with wonderful scripts superb acting imaginative music and cinematography the series deserves its years of high ratings   the main reason is the intelligence with which the writers show in their viewers not every episode has a wrapped up ending the villains dont always get caught and the regulars have their own personal demons to deal with   the shows foundation is william petersen who brings a depth of dimension to his role as the chief of the forensics team   at times harsh and apparently unfeeling he can turn around and show much empathy and compassion and he cares about his team   marg helgenberger as former stripper katherine is a single mother recently separated from her two timing husband timothy carhart she is right on target as a woman trying to mix a career and family george eads is the hunky nick whose desire to please grissom results in some poor decisions but one cant deny his dedication gary dourands warrick is a gambling addict having difficulty shaking the habit jorja fox is the workaholic and lonely sarah who has a fierce loyalty and determination eric zmandza is wonderful as the laidback but frenetic greg and paul guilfoyle is marvelous as former csi chief now detective   the entire supporting cast of regulars is perfect   the show hooks you right away with the lead in case and its not always murder  csi is evidence that television when it sets its mind to it can bring you great viewing   highly recommended

mccourt set out to make a miserable movie about a miserable place in a miserable time   he wanted to succeed in painting a picture so drab and weary that youre likely to leave the theater feeling guilty that you have no holes in your pockets and wonder bread in the cubbard   he does succeed hes made a fine picture but hes made it for himself and not us   its about a grown up boy from limerick coming to terms with the past its really him behind the camera releasing the pain as if it were an exodus from egypt   angelas ashes is therapy for him   its angry and i think thats fine because he just about convinces us that he has the right to make this kind of movie even if we dont   it goes to supersede the kind of realism that the italians were talking about   fellini wrote and directed about childhood poverty but not this kind of poverty he wanted us to identify with the universal human spirit whereas mccourt doesnt think we have the right to   he says that even if youre poor in america youre not this poor and if you are you can still tell your father you love him without being laughed at   there are some emotional payoffs in the movie his aunts unexpected kindness his first sexual experience his luck in finding passage to america   but the movie isnt about those scenes the script and direction dont treat them with the same kind of meticulous care   they dance on the brink of being superfluous they make the film uneven those scenes dont belong in the kind of movie he really needed to make   the contrast isnt strong enough but its a good film and i hope you see it just like i hope mccourt is able to find some closure   after all thats who youre really rooting for the man who wrote the book the voice over that assume his identity youre just not too sure about the characters on the screen   receiving a film is a completely subjective   its very possible you may not respond to this kind of movie you may think it too pretentious and too angry or you may very well find it an enlightening experience   its worth discovering for yourself isnt it

i have to say that the machinist is easily the most unsettling disturbing and bizarre film i have seen so far this year   i mean you can tell from reading the back of the dvd cover and seeing how disturbingly thin christian bale in pictures from the movie that this is not going to be a very happy time   yet last night i was in the mood for something dark and uncompromising   i got it and then some with this cleverly haunting film that is unforgettable   bale plays trevor reznik a troubled and fatigued machinist who hasnt slept for a year   he lives his life in isolation with the few minor exceptions such as a friendly prostitute who takes a liking to him and an airport coffee shop waitress he visits every night   things take a turn for the worst when he meets a fellow machinist for the first time    but nobody knows who this guy is   they tell trevor that he doesnt exist   the paranoia and confusion leads to a horrific accident on the job that involves his co worker   and thats when he gets the strange notes in his apartment   either trevor is completely delusional and has lost his mind    or somebody really is out to get him   whats really intriguing about the movie is that just like trevor we do not know exactly what is real or what is made up   there are times when were doubtful of what were seeing and then we get roped in and second guess ourselves   the movie is a non stop dread fest that just speaks of loneliness and paranoia and thats why it works   it looks and feels exactly like it should   from the very first few minutes its easy to realize that this is going to be one unsettling and dark experience   it is one that you may want to re watch after you see it all   youll definitely think about it for a while after its all said and done but personally i didnt think it was that hard to piece together after it was over   it made sense and it made even more sense on the second viewing   christian bale is fantastic in this   i cant believe he dropped down to around 100 pounds for the role   yes you should be warned that bale looks extremely skinny in this    almost like a walking skeleton as was intended in the script   i think the movie was very well written and directed   this isnt a movie for those who get easily disturbed or freaked out   its a pretty uneasy movie to watch   lets just say you wont feel extremely cheerful after you get done watching this   you may want to put on something funny after youre done otherwise youre going to have this movie stuck in your head while you try to sleep   the dvd has a little to offer in the extra features department such as commentary from the director a making of feature 8 deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer   i really enjoyed the machinist   it surprised me and kept me hooked from beginning to end   i have to say that i kind of missed watching dark movies like this   seems like theres too many cutesy wutesy movies for the family so its good to see something so brutal so raw and so in your face like this   if you want to be disturbed and see something that isnt your typical thriller the machinist is something to put down on your list of movies to see   as depressing and dreadful as this movie can get    im ready to see it again   michael crane

last weekend i went out and saw charlie and the chocolate factory  ive not read the book nor seen the original so i had no expectations for the story   this was typical tim burton fare well directed with impressive visuals and a great cast  burton always manages to assemble a great cast and bring the best out of them  not that johnny depp needs any real coaching to do a good job mind you  the kid actors are splendid which was good to see if they hadnt been capable of doing a good job this movie would have been toast   as for the storyline   its a little oddball and willy wonka clearly is calculating and non personable though imnot sure kids would see it this way    all the kids who suffer horrible fates are clearly suffering pre planned fates  willy wonka is clearly a character which needs redemption and he does get it by movies end but the achievement of that goal seems a little weakly executed  this is a weak point on my part though and shouldnt stop folks from enjoying the movie   this is not tim burtons best work but its still good and definitely something to take the kids out to see

as you probably know the quotwhy we fightquot series was produced by frank capra when he was a major in the u s  army signal corps  the series was commissioned by army chief of staff general george c  marshall as a way of indoctrinating all the troops who signed up in the wake of pearl harbor and the declaration of war  the idea was to make it clear we were doing more than just remembering pearl harbor  eventually the series was shown to the public in theaters across the country  this introductory film in the quotwhy we fightquot series covers the events leading up to the second world war focusing on the rise of fascism in italy and germany the japanese attacks on manchuria and the united states lack of military preparedness  the last is particularly interesting because it implicitly explains pearl harbor not as a japanese victory but rather as an american defeat we lost rather than they won  quotprelude to warquot defines world war ii in black and white terms as the totalitarian worldwide conspiracy threatens to turn the free world into a slave world  admittedly a propaganda film this 1942 documentary is quite informative explaining about hitlers book quotmein kampfquot lebensraum the tanaka plan the london naval treaty the kellogg briand pact the nuremberg laws and even such details as the roman fasces  pthis 54 minute black amp white film won the academy award for best documentary in 1942 and the series as a whole is credited with redefining the documentary as an art form  of great historical value it must be underscored that quotprelude to warquot is not exactly propaganda in the most pejorative sense of the term  the films great quotsinquot along those lines is that it makes the case that public opinion was moving in the direction of joining the war  instead of dismissing this film and capras efforts as the american counterpart to what goebbels was doing in nazi germany it is more accurate to think of it as being the film equivalent of a prosecutors speech in a trial  quotprelude to warquot makes much better use of evidence without the radical distortion you usually find in classic examples of propaganda

this time the guys from rifftrax take on galaxy invader a bad sci fi  horror movie from the 80s  the first half is consistently funny with many jokes about the white trash rednecks who populate the town that the movie is set in  however the riffers seem to run out of the steam later on in the film with less jokes  i cant blame them though as the movie does get pretty boring later on and there really isnt much to joke about  most of the cheesy stuff does happen earlier in the movie after all  still this one is definitely worth seeing for fans of mystery science theater 3000 and rifftrax

the plot of the movie is uninteresting and mulder and scully are out of character to boot   i watched every episode of x files seasons 1 7 but not a single episode of seasons 8 and 9 so i never know our beloved fbi agents as a couple  to see these two talking about divorcing or separating i am thinking what the heck if you never watched an x file episode or the first movie you would never have known the real mulder and scully from this movie  where is the spunky vivacious and confident scully where is the sometimes kooky but brilliant minded mullder where is their chemistry  this movie is just depressing  not because my favorite non couple got older and dont look the same as before but because they are just sad  is it true when people grow older they just grow sadder i refuse to believe

from beginning to end the film tango is infused with exquisite music and superb dancing  although the story line is rather confusing and uninteresting it works to glue all the dazzling tangos together and to offer some reason for the amazing variety of dances  with repeated watchings you begin to notice the subtle themes in the music and choreography that repeat throughout adding an invisible but powerful underlying rhythm to the production  for those dancing tango now its fun to see the differences between current styling techniques and those shown in this ten year old film  cecilia narovas dancing is phenomenal her only dance with juan carlos copes at the very end of the film is a classic

thats the ultimate question that living legend clint eastwood asks in gran torino thematically perhaps the finest movie of his long and distinguished career  as everyone knows eastwood has aged beautifully as both an actor and director over the past 20 years and both the timing and venue of his exploration of the american character either through planning coincidence or a bit of both is impeccable   with the american economy in meltdown and the auto industry dented badly by foreign competition retired ford worker walt kowalski tries to keep both his cherished gran torino and his way of life intact as the ground shifts beneath him in a newly globalized world  with his wife and most of his generation having passed on and immigrants visible reminders of kowalskis time in asia representing an ever larger portion of an uneasy melting pot eastwoods newest anti hero defaults to racial stereotypes as a defense mechanism as do the street gangs representing various ethnic groups staking out their own turf  then suddenly the neighborhood erupts as does kowalskis long dormant soul and theres no turning back   trying desperately to preserve his way of life kowalski comes to accept that americas future will have a whole new face to it  those willing to keep america great may not look like the men who fought alongside him in korea but they must be armed with the tools they need to rebuild their neighborhood city and country  sizing up the personal character of his young hmong immigrant neighbor who doesnt have a chance in warding off the advances of asian on asian bullying kowalski seeks to provide both literally and figuratively the personal equipment that this new american needs to successfully assimilate  just maybe in the back of his mind this aging crusty polack remembers that despite all the ethnic jokes tossed around among his circle immigration has always contributed to the next wave of growth in america   with his soul stirring kowalski finally takes confession but he leaves unstated the biggest sin of his life killing other human beings  for the relatively innocuous sins that kowalski proffers hes asked to atone with some basic catholic rituals  but kowalski has another method of atonement in mind one that for someone who professes to be not in the least religious manifests a very christ like demonstration of selflessness   by the time kowalski devises his plan of individual and neighborhood salvation he realizes that enemy and ally cannot be pidgeonholed into ethnic or territorial classifications just as the meaning of family is no easy thing to define  he understands that the model of living that he has preserved for so long must be torn up and that he must recalibrate how he views the world for the good of his soul   gran torino is at turns a humorous poignant and searing movie with pitch perfect acting by eastwood and an earnest and endearing cast of novice supporting actors  it is destined to be a classic  even the spate of foul language   which accurately reflects the tone and sound of the streets like kowalskis all across america   does not diminish the significance of this work   this is a muscle car of a movie that idles in your mind

although moonraker 1979 made a heap of money the filmmakers of the james bond film franchise wisely decided to bring our hero back to earth this time   it is surprising though that with all the commentary lauding  the return to fleming that the films directly after this one slowly but  surely drift away from fleming yet again   this could have been roger  moores fnest bond if not for the fatal flaw of the music   i like some of  the score   the music during the pre credits sequence meshes nicely with  the action   but that discordant piano and rachets for the beginning of the  ski chase  bland tv type music at best   thank god it is absent from the  soundtrack album   director john glens editing expertise stands him in  good stead in setting the pace but no bond film should be over two hours  long   it must be moores languid delivery which adds to the length   in  some scenes moore looks old and in others he looks great and all the  establishing shots expertly edited in with the stuntmen adds a great deal   there is a freshness to for your eyes only that is important in setting the  tone for the bond films of the 80s   and im glad to see the special  edition does not shy away from references to blofeld nor the non eon  production never say never again

eastwoods unadorned baby is a cinematic masterpiece  million dollar baby arrives like an olympian returning from the games in a ticker tape parade draped in gold medals seven oscar nominations two golden globes countless awards from critics associations and a place at the top of most top 10 lists   its almost too much for such a modest movie to bear  which is not to say that million dollar baby is undeserving of the praise it is one of three bona fide masterpieces clint eastwood has made along with unforgiven and mystic river   but it is so unadorned so beautifully spare and old fashioned in its storytelling it deserves to be seen without hype and without expectations  ideally you would come across it by accident late at night on a cable movie channel  that way it could work its deceptive power lulling you into thinking youre watching a small straightforward boxing movie when in fact youre watching a movie that quietly and movingly takes on all the big themes life death family love faith and what we owe to the people we love   it tells a story we think weve seen before countless times a scrappy young fighter shows up in the gym of a cynical over the hill trainer asking for a chance to be a contender  yeah yeah   except this boxer is a woman and at 31 shes not all that young  the trainer tells her shes too old and anyway he doesnt work with girlies   but maggie fitzgerald hilary swank wont be dissuaded  shes paid for a membership to the hit pit and she keeps showing up day after day working the heavy bag by herself in the corner  the gym manager an old one eyed fighter named scrap morgan freeman takes a shine to her and talks the cynical trainer frankie dunn clint eastwood into taking her on   shes got something scrap says   and here is where the movie takes its first turn by acknowledging its boxing movie stereotypes and cliches  yeah frankie growls back but heart isnt enough   dont let the growl fool you  maggie sure doesnt  as it turns out heart   that hardy bromide not only of sports movies but of showbiz movies   is the subject of this unassuming movie and eastwood takes his time examining the ones belonging to scrap maggie and frankie   maggie as scrap tells us in his quiet melancholy narration is a hillbilly who always knew she was trash  shes determined to escape her past through boxing though the movie   which guards its secrets and leaves a lot unexplained   never reveals how she took up the sport  it just shows us her oddly polite ferocity her childish delight in hitting people and knocking them down   eastwood gallops through a series of her fights as she aims for the championship and whats striking about swanks fine performance is how much she tells us about maggie through her boxing  theres no rage there swank bulked up and buzzing with a joyful energy locates in maggie the same inarticulate desire for acceptance that she found in teena brandon in boys dont cry   at 74 eastwood has honed his own performances to an almost zen stillness he embodies the less is more aesthetic offsetting the big emotions of the script with his quiet gruffness  he has secrets too   he has an estranged daughter he goes to mass every day only to quiz the priest with theological impertinence he reads yeats and studies gaelic   and they have made him wary of connecting   the mellow freeman so memorable opposite eastwood in unforgiven is his perfect partner coming in like a sax player in a jazz trio to add a mournful counterpoint to the main themes played by eastwood and swank  eastwood adds a few side players too maggies trailer trash mother margo martindale and her awful siblings the gym rats another manager who tries to steal maggie from frankie   million dollar baby comes from a collection of boxing short stories by f x  toole the pseudonym of longtime boxing manager and corner man jerry boyd  but it in its clean well lighted eloquence it has the feel of a story by ernest hemingway a story that takes place in boxing rings and diners about people who seek faith and redemption and love without being able to speak of it   as it builds toward its heartbreaking resolution its apparent plainness becomes purity its artlessness becomes art

i am a teenager   i still enjoy the joys of high school   and let me say that ferris buellers day off is still pertinent as well as enjoyable pive seen the ending numerous times on tv but this very night  i decided to watch the whole thing   i rented it with a friend and loved  it   tomorrow i will go out and buy the dvd pjohn hughes was one of the  precursors of such great writer directors as kevin smith and this film is  evidence   it may have different focuses and some might find this difficult  to interpret as some reviews have said pi say quotbull quot  this  film captures high school   even if all the teachers arent as boring the  administration is still spreading the same lies that the principal  character does in the film   he tries for authority and only pulls off  incompetence pwith humor light youthful cynicism and carefree but  intelligent views on life i can attest to ferriss own accuracy   i may  not be as successful but i see myself as a buelleristeven if it wasnt  intended pso what if the movie ends seriously  thats what high school  is  therere good times hilarious times   and then theres learning who  you are   coming to terms   i was moved by ferris buellers day off   in a  world where accuracy often means disgusting hack films like american pie  this movie captured school days masterfully   films that take the act of  growing up and make it a sick joke are insulting in my opinion   american  pie featured the darker side of growing up   people who are self centered  and petty   what a life to start in such a way   ferris bueller is shown  to be human and moral as he speaks about his friends however   his  analyses are wonderful and caring while not being sugar coated   the film  was true but tasteful succinctly and accurately showing the trials of  growing up pits over the top but anyone who was interesting in high  schooland childhood in general im sure can attest to memories that  seem larger than life   while it may be difficult to watch ferris bueller  run up slides and jump on trampolines all to get home with a serious eye  one must admit that when one looks back at school some things are like  that even if only in your mind pferris buellers day off works on levels  that only one who is or has been young can appreciate

this is a great dvd to enhance your childs understanding of concepts learned at school   however i dont recommend sitting down and watching it all the way through like a regular movie   not knowing this we sat down to watch the movie after receiving the dvd   after several lessons we felt a bit bombarded  it would be much better to only watch 2 or 3 target lessonsdiscussing concepts during or after

there are many who know who mr  bean is  there are some who may not  both would be pleased to see a movie featuring this character that is suitable for the whole family   actor rowan atkinson created the character of mr  bean for english television some time back  a hit overseas the show became a staple much like monty python winding up on pbs where enthusiastic viewers fell in love with the dimwitted character whose luck always seemed to turn out good   in mr  beans holiday we find mr  bean the lucky winner of the church raffle for an all expenses paid trip to the french riviera including a camcorder to record his trip  but just like the tv show no trip for someone like mr  bean could turn out normal   along the way bean ends up accidentally separating a young boy and his father  to make amends he attempts to help the two reunite  but again were talking bean here not a normal hero  the adventures of the pair as they try to make their way to cannes where the boys father is are hilarious  and all of them are captured on video as bean shoots everything   atkinson is a great physical comedian but not in a pratfall sort of way  he is one to put to use his entire body in emoting and drawing out an idea on screen  bean is a character who sees the world through child like eyes who never realizes hes done something wrong until afterwards  and yet this innocence is what makes him so endearing   the idea of an englishman stuck in france with no ability to speak the language helps rather than hinders the story  the strength of atkinsons mr  bean has always been his physicality rather than wordplay and that strength if given a white canvas on which to paint with this set up   while the laughs might be as funny as some found in the original series there are plenty on hand  and these are jokes and situations that young and old alike can find something to laugh at   tolstoy it isnt but if youre looking for something to make you laugh by all means give mr  bean a try  and once you get through this movie check and see if the local video store has the series on hand as well  youll be glad you did

when watching remains of the day you never really get to see emma thompson and anthony hopkins show one another any real affection  in this movie they actually have great chemistry and while emma takes on the role of a much more subservient woman she is much more radiant  if you are a fan of her acting you will definitely want to see this movie   this is a movie which takes some patience to view and the artistic elements are well worth waiting for  the schlegel sisters get themselves into a few trying situations and the men they love either fail miserably or protect them from the world   margaret emma thompson is the smarter of the sisters and yet she lacks heart in certain situations  she seems quite happy to let others save her but is not as willing to sacrifice to save a friend  her sister falls in love with a young bank clerk and while trying to assist him is seduced and ruined  she is not following the laws of her society and therefore is rejected at first   this is a tangled web involving the cultured and underprivileged  margaret and helen are independent and well educated and when they meet leonard bast samuel west their lives are changed forever   a somewhat somber ending because we are not sure any of the characters really get what they first wanted  i found this movie to be enjoyable yet felt tense throughout the movie because there is always the thought that the sisters have ruined an innocent  leonard is really the tragic hero in this story because he took on a responsibility neglected by mr  wilcox who has his eye on margaret   all i have to say is   dont let anyone steal your umbrella   if you enjoy movies that make you think about more than what is happening on screen this is a good movie that will make you contemplate the fate of others around you in your world  you could hold someones destiny in your hands even if it is not as dramatic as the story in this movie   the rebecca review

when this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries i was skeptical because i had been disappointed in the stories of abraham and jacob   this film though is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of joseph   it is truly astounding with a stellar cast  paul mercurio is incomparable as joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance   he tears the heart right out of you  no less superb is lesley ann warren as potiphars lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails   this film is incredible and not to be missed  i always cry buckets of tears at the end  a true masterpiece in every way

the town  when this film was first released i was all kinds of excited since i am a huge jeremy renner and a ben affleck fan as well  add in that not only do i like those two as actors but i thought afflecks first film gone baby gone was great  so needless to say that we my little group of friends and such really wanted to see this movie and were excited about it  of course we loved it but i must say that this dvdblu ray combo pack is great with an extended version  add in the behind the scenes features and you have one great combo pack   the story follows a group of charlestown bank robbers as the fbi is looking into them after a recent successful heist  it turns out that while they did this they took a hostage and after letting her go they wonder if she will be a problem  so doug macray affleck takes on the responsibility of finding out what she knows she wont recognize him because they robbers were wearing masks of course  but has the heat from the fbi increases and dougs feelings for her grow the rest of the crew becomes restless  the problem being of course is has doug falls for her he wants even more to get out of the game but they have one more big job to do   i have to say that while some of not liked this as much as me i really enjoyed this film and found it to be very well done  i have to give ben create because i really do like this film and as a writerdirector he is really becoming a top guy i the business  as an actor i have always liked him he has a certain charisma that shines through  of course my boy jeremy renner was excellent in this film as james coughlin in fact if bale had not won the best supporting actor award at the oscars i would say it would have gone to this man  while he brings a nice intensity to the character i actually see the sympatric side of the character that a lesser actor may not have brought out   rebecca hall does a great job as bens love interest claire and plays a very real character very well done  jon hamm is the fbi guy after the crew and does an excellent job here as well as does every one in the film very well cast and cast with actual residents of charlestown  i would also like to point out that renner spent all his time with actual bank robbers from charlestown to get the character and the accent down right  based on a novel called prince of thieves by chuck hogan affleck has proven that even if he wants to leave acting he has a career in filmmaking   this is one of my favorite films and that may be because i have been following renners career since his first film but hey i enjoyed it  i also recommend that you check out renner in dahmer as it is one of the best performances ever  i do highly recommend this film and say go ahead and buy it skip the rental  i bought it the day it was released and have watched it many times since

when it comes to this film i am so utterly in the wrong demographics that i feel quite silly putting in my two cents worth   but here it is anyway  sometimes you flip thru channels and stumble on a movie that you somehow end up seeing all the way thru  so for me and what a girl wants  young amanda bynes has never really registered on my radar before but its hard not to get in her corner when you see her perky self go to work   seems like nothing is original anymore  what a girl wants has drawn comparisons to a hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb000209kmwthe princess diaries 2 disc collectors seta but apparently its roots go back further to a 1958 comedy film the reluctant debutante starring rex harrison and sandra dee which in turn was adapted from a 1956 play of the same name by some cat named william douglas home  cinderella of course is the grandmama of inspirations for movies like this   what a girl wants is fluff fluffity fluff but enjoyable and the sort of lighthearted lightweight teen chick flick which the young girl audiences and i guess me gobble up like mms  theres even a touch of that girl empowerment thing going on  but if you say you cant guess how the plot will play out then pardon me but my bullcrap detector just exploded  the set up goes like this 17 years ago a young british noble colin firth and a gorgeous free spirited american girl kelly preston meet and fall in love in morocco and get married in a bedouin wedding ceremony  he takes her to his posh estates in england only to have disapproving forces scheme to separate the two  she leaves in tears he lets her leave  he doesnt know shes pregnant   amanda bynes plays new york teenager daphne reynolds who runs away from her single parent mother to seek out her englishman dad in london  to catch us up daphnes father is now lord henry dashwood currently engaged to be married and a popular candidate in the upcoming elections and he still doesnt know he has a daughter  so as you may guess daphnes unexpected arrival introduces a wrench in the works a fly in the ointment a fart in the wind  bring on the belles and balls and the anticipated father daughter culture clash as the rest of the movie tells of how plucky and sweet collide with repressed and snooty   whats a story like this though without a wicked social climbing stepmummy or a conniving step sister theres even a dashing young jack of all trades to lend a hand to daphne as well as a kindly british grandmum who we sense from the start would have daphnes back and who ends up with films best line that one about hugs  but the real connection is between amanda bynes and colin firths daughter and dad characters  its quite fun watching daphne gradually begin to have an effect on her stiff upper lipped father and seeing this portrait of restraint and decorum loosen up by inches  the films high point for me may well be that scene with lord dashwood in tight leather pants playing air guitar in front of the mirror   bonus features the dvd offers the following two sets of audio commentary one by the film director and the screenwriters the other by amanda bynes for those preferring a more like youthful testimonial fashion and etiquette 101   the films costume designer shay cunliffe goes over the casts wardrobe and etiquette instructor maggie ofarrill nags about the proprieties whats a girl to wear   a game requiring a good memory for daphnes outfits as a guy i refuse to play this 3 additonal scenes totalling 1 minute 39 seconds the theatrical trailer and the film cast  crew credits   what a girl wants pushes all the right feel good buttons and rides on the talent and credibility of the cast  amada bynes demonstrates an unaffected likeable quality nicely balancing her goofy exuberance with pratfalls and even a dash of romance  with her the stodgy brits never really had a chance  equally key is colin firth pitch perfect as the impeccable uncomfortable lord dashwood who as the film progresses regains that inner cool he had back in his youth when he listened to rock n roll and sported a more hip wardrobe  firth manages to pull off being simultaneously reserved yet charming  again  having seen a hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb00005mp58pride and prejudice   the special edition ae 1996a and a hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb00005jmfqlove actually widescreen editiona i shouldnt be surprised  kelly preston is good as libby daphnes beautiful bohemian mom who raises daphne to be carefree yet grounded you could see why even after all these years lord dashwood still thinks of her  libby is a wedding singer which gives preston a chance to actually sing the songs  shes not bad   sappy last paragraph this film may be tailored for the youngsters but it doesnt necessarily snub the old fogies  when i told a buddy of mine that id seen this movie and liked it he dismissed the film as fluff fluffity fluff  obviously i disagree  theres always a place for charming teen comedy flicks not only in the hearts of young whippersnappers but also in the wrinkled cockles of the decrepit  in its predictability and retelling of that same old message be true to yourself it doesnt insult our intelligence as much as reaffirm certain values  so i take back what i said about not being in this films target demographics  with me the film is apparently spot on

classic movie which is very enjoyable   my only concern is that i really dont see any real viewing improvement in the blu ray version over the standard dvd   perhaps this is due to the fact that much of the film occurs in relative darkness so it appears a bit grainy   probably not worth the extra expense to buy blu ray over the standard dvd

this was without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen   saw a preview on tv one day and had to wait about 4 months for it to come to the theater   well worth the wait i can say  everybody is offering their review and thankfully most are positive   however there was one particular scene that just had me   its when george realizing his fame and fortune are near an end and he is sitting in his living room looking out the window and its raining   the camera angle has his face and the raindrops that are falling down from the windows reflect on his face and it looks as though he is crying   incredible  this is what great filmmaking is all about   i thought the acting was superb and even the extras in the film were terrific   when the dog has to run to the cop for help notice the lady standing on the corner   she reminds me of everybodys aunt and she has that look about her that was just terrific   go see this wonderful film and i for one cannot wait until it arrives at my home in a few weeks   i will watch it over and over because its one of those rare excellent films that allow you to savor them again and again

extremely reminiscent of cold war sleepers like gorky park and reds gymkata is one of the most carefully scripted and brooding commentaries on american foreign policy during the reagan years  the film is more like a documentary than a work of fiction in its deep attention to historical accuracies and avoidance of hyperbole   robert clouses directorial adaption of dan tyler moores pulitzer shortlisted novel manages to capture timbre of the times and the voice of the decade in a script of intricate complexity   kurt thomass portrayal of the hero across from tetchie agbayanis heroine is one of the most dynamic and surprising chemistries since bogart and bergmans 43 years before   however where casablanca fell far short of documenting the spirit and fears of the times on a granular level gymkata and its cast is unafraid to take this plunge   in characterizations deeply respectful and yet photo accurate regarding world cultures and global motifs gymkata manages spell the poly sided views of complex conflicts that occurred during the final grey gasps of the cold war   amazingly gymkata manages a foreshadowing the rise of the neo cons some 20 years later in its depictions of the united states use of aggression in strategically important hotspot regions    and as well    the film is able to show that the nationalistic concerns of the competing sovreignties both ally  foe remain unchanged despite which decade these events play themselves out in   a timeless film gymkata should be a core film study in every graduate level political science class

this is not a perfect christmas movie by any means period   the pros the snow and all the christmas stuff and atmosphere is cute charming and puts you in the holiday spirit   the main characters sudden change at the end was too convenient and the sad story at the end thats meant to touch us seems forced and just thrown up there to tie all the loose ends of the film   granted yes when i originally watched it it made me tear up because i thought it was sweet my father died in july and this was one of his favorite christmas movies so i will probably tear up again at that part just because    i miss him and know he enjoyed this movie   the humor and slapstick in the movie was so so it was extremely forced and strained and unfortunately this was easy to spot which ruined the so called comedy of the movie immediately   i felt like i was forcing myself to even chuckle during this movie when i first saw it on dvd back in 2005    the acting from almost everyone involved is horrible tim allen and jamie lee curtis were not that bad but they seemed to be zombies just reading their lines through half the movie jamie lee curtis characters screaming also got extremely annoying irritating and aggravating after a while talk about overacting to the point of no return   tim allens character as usual like in most of his movies tries way too hard to be funny and its not convincing or interesting for the most part unfortunately   the supporting characters an annoying whiny kid 2 idiotic cops who add nothing to the movie whatsoever a daughter who changes her mind at the last minute and decides to come home for christmas with her good looking boyfriend  2 friends of jamie lee curtises you only see 2 freaking times throughout the movie neighbors that are so grating youd want to punch them all out and a mayor with the most annoying monotone voice ever heard and as intimidating as a pussy cat would be   the only neighbors that are nowhere near as annoying are the kindly elderly woman and her husband dealing with health issues  they were pretty much the only real characters worth sympathizing or caring about period   oh i forgot a ridiculous part of the movie revolves around a petty robber that adds nothing to the movie whatsoever again and a mysterious stranger who offers the main character an umbrella at the beginning of the movie with this being a christmas movie and all i am sure people can guess who he turns out to be in the end i loved the snow the christmas decorations but the story itself was ridiculous and the lengths these insane neighbors go to is extremely stupid and not even the least bit believeable either

as a child future director paul verhovens playground was the recently bombed out homes of his neighbors  the absurd violence in the world seems to be reflected in all his movies  i have been involved with four verhoven films while on the rob bottin effects crew  verhoven made a name for himself directing the edgy and funny quotrobocopquot originally receiving an x rating for the violence in his directors cut  total recall and starship troopers are other wild examples of his romance with ultra violence  he has always made films that push limits of acceptable social boundaries  before he directed showgirls he tested the publics tolerance for a sex with buckets of blood with his thriller basic instinct    basic instinct is a hitchcock style murder thriller featuring sharon stone who is quotdressed to killquot as famous author catherine trammel a dead ringer for kim novak in vertigo a violent icepick murder seems to have been taken right out of her recent novel  arrogant and cool she actually invites the police investigators to wonder if she did it in the now legendary interogation scene where she crosses her legs and shoots detective curran michael douglas an eyeful of her unpantied intimate territory  curran is investigates her a little too closely and compromises his integrity by getting ensnared in her sexual web  did she do it or is it the copycat work of a crazed fan even intimately close to the suspect detective curran doesnt really know for sure  even though this is the unrated directors cut you wont find some of the most extremely gory footage  stone shot a scene in the nude where she straddled a realistic torso of a victim  repeatedly plunging the icepick into the chest and face  splattered with fake blood and feeling in her arm the sensation of the pick piercing this rubbery body the illusion was all too real  sharon became nauseous and had to leave the set  also missing gus george dzunza takes a nasty icepick in the cheek  basic instinct is a stylish and dark film that can be frustrating and uncomfortable as it never quite fully allows you to know all its secrets  but it is intriguing none the less   personally i was always uneasy with the boundaries verhoven likes to push but this is a better film than expected  verhoven has had several unfulfilled dreams to push even harder but so far has been thwarted  for example quotcrusadequot another arnold movie quashed in negotiations quotcrusadesquot had a scene where scharzenneger is found with his head sticking out of the backside of a donkeys rear end  verhoven often joked with rob bottin about making a film designed to enrage his critics called jesus 2000  rob thinks he would have seriously done it if he was given the money    overall if you are a fan of basic instinct there is a lot for you on this disc  two commentaries  one by verhoven and the other by a feminist author as well as deleted scenes and some behind the scenes featurettes  the novelty plastic case with plastic ice pick was probably a bad idea as the hinges break very easily  be careful when opening or you will be pretty ticked off

youll be creeped out have your heart broke and have it mended all in one hour and a half  well maybe not but if youre like me you will all i really knew going into this movie was that it was spanish and that that kid with the sack on his head scared the crap out of me so i was pretty prepared for the scary stuff but didnt think the movie would be so moving as well  in a way its not so much a horror movie as it is a movie about dealing with loss  dont get me wrong theres a lot of creepy moments in the movie   just not as much as your average everyday horror movie  most the scary moments are due to atmosphere and tension as opposed to jump scares  so if you like the monsters popping out at you youll be bummed out  but if a sense of impending dread is something you enjoy i think youll dig the movie   the movies basic plot is this a woman was an orphan and moves back into her childhood orphanage as an adult in hopes to reopen it  her husband and son move in as well and her son begins to gain more and more imaginary friends  where it goes from there i will not say but its not always what you expect  i dont think its much of a spoiler to say that the son goes missing and from there the movie become much more of a psychological study of loss   and a rather good one at that   the conclusion of the movie wasnt quite what i expected but thats a good thing  the orphanage is really a beautiful take of the classic peter pan story and a movie i look forward to visiting again  the movie is also beautiful on bluray and a very nice upgrade from the dvd

wow anything more dishonest ive never seen  i thought at some point that ben stein was an intelligent fellow but after seeing him fall for this intelligent design creationism garbage i think hes an utter dolt  the movie is sheer propaganda for the discovery institute and their nutty ignorant ideas nothing else  the misquoting of charles darwins words is shameful and the implied link between evolution and nazism has to be one of the most vile and revolting things ever suggested  that hitler thought he was doing gods work by killing jews is of course never mentioned

some folks have complained that this film is offensive to gay men  this is not entirely true  it is offensive to any living breathing human being  not just that it presents gays as stereotypical sissies how daring is that but the story is so over bloated and rehashed with tv level unintelligence that its drolly unwatchable  cuba gooding jr  seems to have had a bad run of movies lately and horatio sanz is the non humorous overweight sidekick with no good lines  you know the plot  its no more than what is in the previews  the only thing believable about this film was roger moore as an older queen and that scared the living daylights out of me pnote that his film is unrated  there is no nudity and very little foul language  however there is a scene that i cannot describe here   just think a gay version of theres something about mary and hair gel  unbelievably tacky awful stuff  you were warned

you can tell singer has respect for the original donner film just by starting the film like the original did and not going for some flashy cgi wowzer opening like the x men movies do  i enjoyed this film not as much as i had hoped for but still as superhero movies go its up there nowhere close to the spiderman franchise maybe right next door to the fantastic 4 entertaining fluffy but not very filling  personally i think brandon routh did his best to portray a character that diehard and may i say fanatical people will always associate with christopher reeve reeve did his version i say give routh the chance to step up to the challenge and not be forever in reeves shadow   as for lois lane horrible the casting was bad  enough said   kevin spacey is a great actor  no denying that but luthor needs a little more than being dark and sarcastic he needs that kind of presence that makes you believe this guy would smile in your face as he chokes the life out of you like hackman did so well  obviously the flying scenes were pretty good with the help of cgi you could believe this guy was flying around metropolis   all in all not a great film but not that bad either hopefully singer has listened to his fans and will correct the glitches for the upcoming the man of steel

lonesome while containing a couple of sequences that contain dialogue should really be considered a silent film   the silent sequences as well as the innovative camera work which evokes the experimental techniques employed in german cinema is what makes this film work and elevates is above many of the films of the era  the premise of the film centers on a lonesome man and an equally lonesome woman who meet at coney island and make a connection  what might be a blissful moment of discovery is interrupted by a roller coaster fire when the pair are separated  interspersed with scenes from chaotic urban existence dream sequences and the momentary respite at the beach are interesting camera angles  the film also includes color sequences  visually this film is a delight and it tells a story with minimal dialogue i e  dialogue cards  as interesting as sunrise was visually it pales in comparison to lonesome  the camera work is not only interesting but really quite advanced for its time  for me the photography is a large part of the story because it sets the mood and tone of the picture as it progresses  the only negative is the amateurish rendering of dialogue in the talking sequences  the inclusion of dialogue was no doubt a tip of the hat to the new technology which would quickly overtake the industry but it was more irritating than constructive in terms of storytelling  i would have preferred it if they hadnt included the three talking sequences and just left the movie alone when it was remastered  also included in this set are director paul fejos musical broadway as well as the last performance with the awesome  conrad viedt and screen vixen evelyn brent  both films are interesting but i really view them as bonuses as lonesome is the film to watch as it is the most interesting of the trio

first i just would like to think that if its your time to leave this earth than maybe its just the time  its like if you want to go back in time if you mess with something you make the future different  and in the sense of the movies if you are gonna mess with death and try to cheat it its just going to come back in full circle and get you eventually  dont mess with karma death life destiny faith whatever else goes in that category   two what i thought of the movies final destination for sure is my favorite out of the four  i have always been a fan of devon sawa  i felt like the effects were done just right  it kept me guessing through the whole movie and the ending was great made me so excited to see the next one   final destination 2 i was having trouble playing this one in my dvd  it wouldnt bring me to the menu to play the movie  it would just get stuck after the animation of the logo  i tried it on my laptop and it went past the animation and to the previews to the main menu  so put it back in my dvd player and just somehow got it to go to the end where its the extra features are and than just went to the menu and playing it from there   it annoyed me so much  but the movie itself wasnt a bad add on to the first movie i thought it went well just going on with the story from where it left off  effects were good as well   final destination 3 this is where i dont know if they should have stopped these after this one or before  im already not a fan of roller coasters or tanning beds and this one really makes me want to stay away from those two things for sure the story was pretty good but at this point i was thinking this is stupid   not the story  by itself it handled its own but for as the whole package you tend to know whats coming or think yea i seen this before you people are funny thinking you could stop this  i liked how they used the pictures as on whos next on the list  that was pretty cool  i think they could have stopped after the second one and have this one as a totally different movie and named it something else actually   the final destination aka 4 ugh this is the one i enjoyed the least  i liked the things he saw and how they did that but the effects at the beginning with the race and them getting crashed by the ceiling it was like yea that was definitely made by a computer  the part i dug was the mechanic getting slammed against the fence so hard that it cut him all the way through and the diamond shaped chunk of body falls off i felt like the acting was definitely worse of the four i wanted to smack every one of them for their stupidity thats how their acting felt like they had no talent and didnt convince me of anything   three im annoyed that there is a fifth one  you say final but yet you change your darn mind and make another grr not going to lie i will probably watch it but im pretty sure everyone already knows whats going to happen and just like all other sagas it just keeps getting worse and worse as the number of movie gets higher  only movies that i havent felt a saga sucking after the first two is a hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb002r3g912saw complete horror collection dvd box 1 2 3 4 5 unrated uncut i vaa hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb00303gt3qsaw vi rated full screen editionaa hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb003q6d27ssaw the final chaptera   i love saw lt3 but anyway as a whole of the final destinations   im in the middle  i like them but i do want them to end  why like i said at the beginning to mess with stuff like that if its supposed to happen it will

i just saw this on dvd and have to say that it is simply stunning  i sat through it entirely mesmerized the whole time  the visuals are incredibly beautiful the story was very engaging and theres tons of action  some of the scenes can seem somewhat silly but as long as you realize that this is a fantasy film and let yourself be immersed in this fantasy world you will enjoy it  i have the 103 min version which i understand was shortened from the original 121 min version to make the story easier to understand  i sort of wished i had the longer version as i was sad the movie ended so soon

i really wanted to like this film because of the actors involved in it  james mcavoywho was excellent in the last king of scotland  narnia keira knightly and vanessa redgrave were the lures here plus the film had received excellent reviews   however the direction was plodding and that was a big surprise to me because i had liked joe wrights direction in the previous film to this pride  prejudice also with keira knightley   because of this and despite mcavoys and redgraves excellent acting i felt disengaged from the film   also knightley somehow lacks that something that made the late audrey hepburn magnetic and so i felt little of mcavoys passion for her because of this  so regretfully 2 stars which means okay but no bonnets for this very over rated film check out the french lieutenants woman for comparison

what do you expect to see in a moviepas a movie made by taiwanese who are influenced by both the traditional chinese culture and modern western civilization yi yi is not an ordinary one  it is a film about nothing since you cannot even tell what exactly the story is in a few words  it is however also a movie about everything of human life because it does touch many aspects of our experience the attitude toward the career fortune family lover and the ultimate faith of the life  yi yi explores the questions you and i might encounter in our daily life but it also leaves no simple miracle solution to them just like that there is no easy answer to the real problem in this real world  pif you think a movie should tell a simple story which leads to a sure answer you probably will not like yi yi  if you expect to see an exotic oriental fantasy you definitely will feel bored and hate it  on the other hand if you appreciate that a film merely depicts the happiness and the sadness from the routin life and catches the subtle emotions you should see this one  you might also feel surprised about the similarity between a modern asian city and the western world  pprobably you had better not raise your expectation too high before you see it but you might feel satisfied with how richness yi yi could bring to you at the end

unparalleled cinematography allows the viewer to soar with so many types of birds primarily geese and ducks many times at eye level with the birds  you see hear and feel the effort that goes into every stroke of their wings as the birds make their way from migratory start to finish  and there are spectacular  moments of serendipity such as the decoy scene  all these elements equal outstanding filmmaking  the movie stirs the conscience and conscious too helping us realize we must care for our environment and the creatures with whom we share this planet without beating us over the head with a zealous ecological message    the soundtrack at times lifts you with the birds and at times is little more than repetetive euro pop trash however the images on screen draw your attention more than the music  the narration is sparse and not overdrawn  the concluding song has a haunting beauty that makes me mist over even as i recall it    the specs and features listed promise an excellent dvd product  i could watch this film over and over again and i look forward to owning it on an excellent medium  if you love our earth and the winged marvels with whom we share it you will love this movie  guaranteed  if it fails to win for best cinematography at the oscars i will be disgusted  its arguably the best documentary of a season of many fine documentaries

ill be picking up my boxed set this weekend but really im not buying this for the extras although they need more mention   this is just a review of the tv series from my pov   total rating is 4 5 stars   this type of show really is character driven as opposed to plot driven the point is to get to know these characters as opposed to doing a villian of the week show like buffy the vampire slayer   yes there was the plot device of new york city is in danger but each week was really about the characters and getting to know them   so thats my focus   the characters were brilliantly played   unlike many fans of the show i actually found nathan and nikki to be my faves   adrian pasdar is an excellent and really underrated actor who brought a different side to the show   while everyone was in love with peter and hiros joy of being superpowered and everyone related to the high school angst of claires outsider status i think nathan represented the adult whose life has just been given the major upheaval by well life  he was a needed character and adrian pasdar was a great casting decision   nikki was an interesting twist as a character   i like ari lightner but i wasnt 100 sure what the character was all about   once i learned more about her i really liked her   the split personality worked for me but im glad it got integrated by the end of the season   and lest i forget matt   matt to me also made some very interesting decisions throughout the season and i wonder what the fallout will be in september   he took a turn which i dindt see coming but am not surprised with   it was needed to keep him interesting   hiro claire isaac dl peter    they were all great characters   skylar was an excellent villian and hrg was certainly a character who provided endless hours of speculation   its going to be interesting to see what the show does next season   are peter and nathan dead  what about ando now that hiro is in feudal japan  is matt among the living  is sylar alive  and what about kirsten bell dania ramirez and nichelle nichols all brilliant casting decision for characters to come   the camoes and guest characters provided some great plot development especially for matt    lets face it telepaths are boring so he needed a good story   and clea duvall one of the most underrated actresses around gave it to him   the invisible man george takei eden and all the others served good purposes werent just cannon fodder and i wanted them all to join the cast  half a star deduction for  the finale   it was overall great but it needed to be longer   the climactic battle was anything but   it reminded me of the bad flick that was generation x staring finola hughes and based on the marvel comic of the same name   it was really campy and hokey by the end   i wanted it to be better   the decision by nbc to unout claires buddy zach then write him off the show   i see a lot of people pleased with the racially diverse cast and i agree but to have a fake myspace page for the kid listing him as questioning and then redo everyones memories and make him straight then get rid of him was a very poor decision by nbc imo   gay kids deserve role models too you know    they hype   i think the fault really should be laid at the feet of the nbc pr crew   they made the ads   nbc missed the mark a few times with marketing   not the show   but it does factor into my decion to give this a 4 5 star review marked by four instead of five stars   the show needs to deliver and there were times it didnt   i loved the arcs and save the cheerleader are you on the list and the other marketing campaigns were great   except that they were usually a week or two ahead of the actual episode which was aired   do i recommend this show of course   its quality television   overall very well written and acted and its something you could sit down with the kids and watch without worry   there were a few gross out scenes usually involving claire and sylar which may scare younger viewers but its something id let my niecesd and nephews watch   minimal swearing not in your face over the top and constant sexuality simulated comic book esque violence make this a show for most viewers   most of the 2006 season hasnt graduated   really what are the real carry overs  oh right nbcs heroes and abcs ugly betty   thats really it   for all the bad reviews of the show the numbers and survivial and overall critical and fan acclaim speak for themselves   and just because i cant resist ignore the haters   lost fans are disgruntled because this season fell apart and battlestar glactica fans are annoyed fanboys whose favorite show will never get picked up by a major network and theyre just jealous of the commercial and critical success this show has pulled off

i almost didnt rent this film because of the poor ratings   that would have been a big mistake because i found this film to be a powerful emotional story full of symbolism   unlike the other reviewers i did not find it that complex if you understood the symbolism in the story and felt that it was very well put together and had great images   with so much trash out there where the major movie houses just keep repeating the same themes  ideas  movies over and over it is wonderfully refreshing to have thought provoking and unique films such as the fountain to foster and support creativity in ideas and presentation   this film is well worth 0 99 to rent but it is an emotional film so if you are in the mood for a comedy or mindless action film you should probably look elsewhere     enjoy  i did

this review is for the unrated extended blu ray version  plenty of spoilers so read at your own discretion  although my expectations for this movie were pretty low to begin with since the movie wasnt directed by james cameron and t3 wasnt as good as t2 i was at least expecting something that would extend the terminator storyline and mythology from the television show the sarah connor chronicles which was an excellent tv series and from the comics  unfortunately the people who wrote the script for this movie and the director mcg are completely ignorant and clueless when it comes to the entire terminator canon  nothing in this movie makes any sense when you consider the previous three films  its like these people just threw out everything from the first three films and then started making up stuff as they went along without any thought into what came before or the history that cameron created   first in this movie the machines all know who john connor is which makes no sense if you follow the history  the audience is so used to the idea that skynet knows all about connor that this error usually passes over them without any thought but what they forget is that only the machines from the future know who connor is and only because of what he will accomplish in the future  he hasnt done anything yet  all the terminators from the previous films were from the future while the machines in this movie are in the present  the machines have just wiped out most of humanity and now sees them nothing more than a bunch of insects to finish exterminating  connor at this point is just another insect so this idea that he is somehow important to them is ludicrous  dont give me this crap about him being seen as a prophecy or messiah either   second mistake is that the machines all know who kyle reese is which provides one of the biggest plot holes in this movie and goes against even common sense  the entire purpose of the first movie was that the machines didnt know who the father was so their only alternative was to terminate the mother which is why they built the damn time machine in the first place in order to wipe out his entire existence  in fact information about the father was so secretive that not even kyle reese knew it  if the machines know who kyle reese is then why the hell would they even bother building the time machine when connors very existence depends on it how the hell are they going to explain that in future sequels if there will be one this is a massive disaster of a plot hole that cant be overlooked and cant be explained  its idiotic  and dont give me this crap about alternate timelines or other theories on time travel thats different from the one used in back to the future  the rules of time travel and the theory used from the first trilogy have already been in place which is the back to the future scenario so you just dont make up new rules and change the canon to suit your logic  thats similar to that idiotic scene from avp requiem when the predalien lays eggs inside pregnant women for the sole purpose of increasing the alien infestation  only the damn queen lays eggs stupid and that still wouldnt explain why skynet builds the time machine in the future either  third plothole is when skynet captures kyle reese they dont decide to execute him right then and there but instead have some kind of elaborate plot in order to lure connor to execute him  does this make any sense what the hell was mcg what the hell kind of name is this and the writers thinking when they came to this scene forget about your stupid theories on time travel when you cant apply it here see second plot hole  this is so blatantly stupid that words cant describe the idiocy behind it  who writes this stuff and not see the inherent problems with it  fourth problem was when connor arrives the t800 instead of breaking connors neck decides to play ball with him by throwing him around  i thought t800s have detailed files on human anatomy and how to efficiently terminate humans  youd think that having their biggest sought out target within their grasp theyd kill him as quickly as possible and with a gun instead of a naked unarmed arnold   fifth problem comes at the end when they need to do a heart transplant on john using marcuss heart  this scene was supposedly changed due to leakage of the original script but it still doesnt excuse its sloppiness  this scene requires that marcus is an acceptable donor plenty of immunosuppressive drugs a heart surgeon and a team of anesthetics and not a veterinarian and a sterile environment instead of the open desert  i was cringing at this scene and thank god it didnt last very long   now as for the movie itself if you are completely ignorant of the previous three films this movie would be somewhat entertaining for the action scenes alone which were very thrilling  but the audience doesnt really care about any of the characters except for maybe marcus so the movie become nothing more than one action set piece after another  theres really no character development or insight into who these people are and why we should care about them  what made t2 and other movies like it so successful is that we get to know the characters where the audience have an emotional investment so we are concerned about them and anxiously curious about what will happen next  the action is there to supplant the characters not drive them  this movie should have been about how john connor becomes leader of the resistance and help humanity come back from the brink of extinction instead of this goofball storyline filled with plot holes  i wont bother going into the special features on the blu ray or the deleted scenes which have already been discussed  ill just add that the video transfer is impeccable and the audio is excellent as well and is what is expected from blu ray by now   in conclusion if you are expecting forgetful mindless action explosions with killer robots and dont necessarily care about character development or plot then this movie is adequate  but if you are a fan of the terminator franchise then you will be sorely disappointed from the glaring plot holes mistakes and literal lack of respect for the mythology and the fan base  its comparable to george lucas using midichlorians to explain the force  much like having top tiered actors in the phantom menace not even christian bale aka batman can save this turkey  time to terminate this franchise or return it back to cameron

theres a reason the language lessons for this series    which includes german  russian spanish  portuguese french  italian japanese  chinese and arabic hebrew  yiddish    look a little dated they are  but that doesnt take away from their proven effectiveness in the classroom for an age range from older children to adults  the titles are a bit pricey but they really will work to provide those new to a language with enough basics to get along as a tourist or a polite businessman or businesswoman  those with a portable dvd player or laptop can brush up on their lessons before and during their trips

the original last house on the left does not disappoint  it differs in small ways from the modern day remake of the same name  but take heart these little differences are what make this movie stand apart from its remake counter part  though the plot is virtually the same the deaths  are different  lets face it good deaths and plot twists are what  people go to see movies like this for  view this movie if you wish to know how wes craven and sean s  cunningham became the horror icons they are today  you will be pleased with what you find if horror and gore are what you seek  oh and be for warned its not for the casual horror fan or anybody that has a weak stomach  with that being said happy viewing horror fans

i just watched thumbsucker and i know what youre thinking  youre thinking that a movie about a 17 year old kid that sucks his thumb would be really awkward to watch  but actually    okay youre right  watching a 17 year old kid suck his thumb is a little weird  but the thumb sucking part doesnt really last too long  the movie is about justin cobb played by a very good lou taylor pucci  and his journey through his last year of high school  there are girls there are drugs theres a debate team and theres even a slightly creepy  orthodontist played by keanu reeves  and if this sounds like sort of standard teen angst independent movie fair well thats because its sort of standard teen angst independent movie fair  it is however well written well shot nicely edited and boasts an outstanding cast  vincent donorfio didnt know the name but recognized the face  and tilda swinton whos always good  are great as justins parents and vince vaughn does a very solid understated turn as the teacher who leads the debate team  i would also mention that kelli garner is very sexy as the girl justin has a crush on but since shes playing 17 and im a middle aged man it would be kind of creepy  so im just going to let it go  so all in all this is pretty good movie

let me tell you why some americans hate this film  you see this is a chinese film  thats right a film made in that not a democracy china  whats worse its a communist country and an asian one at that now most americans cant read chinese cant speak chinese know diddly squat about china and havent been to china or anywhere outside of their counties for that matter  but they will knock anything chinese they simply hate china for reasons they dont even understand   i have lived in the us for 14 years and i can tell you this more than 80 of americans are an uninformed propaganda driven herd   regardless of the origin of the film i submit that sacrifice for the greater good is a noble cause in any culture  yet you see many americans and brits aussies doggedly obsess over the fact that the film is made in a communist country and the message is a communist one  load of crap  its only an excuse  deep down they hate the film because of their blind hatred for china and disdain for all things asian  take for example braveheart a historically based fiction well received in the us which extols the heroism of william wallace  supposedly willie fights and dies for freedom  but does he die for his freedom to go shop at walmart anytime he desires no  willie is a hero because his cause is supposedly freedom for scotland  of course his fight doesnt really start until his woman is slain and he gets into big big trouble with the brits   in any case the theme is sacrifice for the greater good  americans foam in the mouth praising this film  but if sacrifice for the greater good is communist ideology isnt it evil  hero is not completely historically accurate but which hollywood flick is  hero is simply a story well told and told with astounding visual beauty   its great entertainment and in that respect its nearly perfect   ps   for those of you who cant speak chinese the english translation in this movie is reasonably good although some emotion and power of the chinese language is lost in the process   certain things simply sound lame when expressed in english this goes both ways of course   however there is a major mis translation   the two words written by broken sword actually means all under heaven not our land   not even close   but then its simply impossible to translate some things faithfully from chinese into english without making it sound tacky

i agree with another reviewer who said this film could have been better on so many levels but didnt quit make it   but i will say that in contradition to others i did get quite a few out loud while alone laughs   keaton is a wonderful actress but should focus on being in character and not forcing the character on the viewers   when a role is overacted from the beginning of a file the viewer tends to spend the rest of the film picking it apart   i confess i had to reel myself in because i started to do the exact same thing but then i reminded myself as i always do that it is a movie and its sole purpose is to entertain      overall it is an enjoyable film and i would recommend it to those who enjoyed other films such as the family stone rumor has it monster in law etc

the film includes three main story lines a nave angel of death brad pitt first experiences with simple pleasures such as peanut butter his chosen guides attempts to keep his business based on the principles on which he founded it while coming to terms with his own mortality and a romance between joe black and his guides daughter susan claire forlani  it includes a large quantity of profane language and several emotional themes   the movie opens with an introduction to the guide bill parrish anthony hopkins who doubts that he will live for many more years  indeed he is approached in his home and work by what he thinks are hallucinations wherein death himself has come with the intention of escorting him to the afterlife   bill touched by his dream like brush with mortality expresses his desire for his daughter susan to live a life with passion  she is considering marriage but her father is not favorably impressed by her relationship  when she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech he simply says stay open  who knows lightning could strike   shortly after hearing this advice susan meets a vibrant young man of whom she is instantly enamored  immediately after this encounter the man dies of collision with two cars  death returns to bills home in the form of the young man explaining that his impassioned speech has piqued his deaths interest after an eternity of boredom  given bills competence experience and wisdom death has chosen him and tells bill that in return for an extended lifetime bill shall be his guide on earth  notably during his time on earth deaths personality alters to become mildly curious ruminative and gentle having been worldly sardonic and arrogant until he reveals his appearance   death then places himself at bills right hand under the name joe black and establishes his place in bills home and work instructing bill to reveal his identity to nobody  this last task is complicated when the board of directors of bills corporation are urging a union with a larger company at the instigation of susans fianceacutee drew jake weber  after a tense board meeting wherein bill advises the board against the merger joe ventures into the city to explore it  he visits the hospital where susan works as a doctor to see her and in doing so observes the human aspect of mortality which was apparently unknown to him  a dying guyanese patient recognizes him as a spirit upon learning that he is death she asks to be taken to the afterlife  joe instead soothes her pain and promises to take her later   he returns to visit bill who describes his late wife to whom he was strongly attached  their conversation is interrupted by drew who is bothered by the reversal of bills decision regarding the merger  bill becomes angry at the prospect of the company that he built becoming less than he planned believing that a man should leave something of integrity in his passing whereupon joe cautions easy bill youll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation   realizing that joe could end his delay at any time bill unprecedentedly arranges for dinner with his family two nights in a row prompting them to be afraid  bill attempts a broken and awkward speech focusing on the idea of family after which he invites them all back for dinner again the next night  touched by his feelings they all agree with one exception that being drew who is angered by the presence of joe black who appears to have taken the ear of bill parrish and disrupted drews plans  he is even more rankled by the increasing closeness between susan and joe  after a number of snide comments aimed at joe over dinner drew confronts susan about her feelings for joe which ends in drews uncertainty   after a flirtatious conversation with joe who has overheard the argument with drew susan is warned by bill not to become attached to this mysterious stranger  during the next day drew has gathered the board of the company advising them that parrish has been unconditionally influenced by mr  joe black and telling them that the offer from the rival company will be accepted with or without parrish as chairman   after a scene wherein parrish is reminded of the importance to himself of his family when he distresses his other daughter allison marcia gay harden who is trying to organize bills sixty fifth birthday party he answers the door to drew who starkly threatens that the board will see him removed from the chair  drew then leaves angrily announcing to susan that this is the end of my chapter with the parrishes  and the end began with this guy indicating joe who has also followed  after a tense and crude standoff drew leaves susan and joe alone  they are interrupted by bill who shows concern for his daughter   the following morning parrish is confronted by drew and the board of directors who reiterate their intentions regarding the merger  after bills emphatic refusal to accept both the merger and the boards request for the identity of joe they vote to make bill chairman emeritus thus depriving him of power  after the meeting it is revealed that drew was in collaboration with the rival company with the intention of seizing power and then selling off parrish communications for a huge profit   bill and joe return home where bill disheartened goes for a nap  joe comes across susan after an awkward moment they make love  afterwards he meets with bill who defies this union and reminds joe of his purpose in the universe  joe disregards bills words   shortly after another encounter with bills daughter joe realizes that she is not enamored exactly of him but rather of the man whose body he has assumed  joe returns to bill who tries to entrap drew  joe assists by claiming that he is an irs agent investigating drews dealings a play on the saying death and taxes  bill is restored as chairman and the merger is canceled   in his speech at the lavish gala celebration bill parrish fondly expresses his appreciation to his daughters for their work preparing it as well as his love for both of them  joe later escorts bill out of sight over a nearby bridge presumably to his own death  joe then sends back to life the young man whose body he borrowed allowing susan that chance to pursue a relationship with him  susan tells him she wishes he could have met her father indicating that she understands as hinted earlier that joe black was death and that her father is dead  the story ends as both of them are watching the fireworks celebrating her fathers birthday   although the films story and characters were praised highly many critics felt that its three hour running time was excessive and thus reaction became mixed with one half of the critical spectrum branding it boring and the other half claiming that its slow pace made the story more poignant 1 the academy of science fiction fantasy and horror films nominated it for a saturn award in three categories   best actor best supporting actress and best music   the film was also nominated in the worst remake or sequel category at the razzie awards  gary richied of the westchester gazette gave the movie a 4 star rating citing the academy award deserving performances by pitt and hopkins  it also received positive reviews from siskel and ebert who gave it two thumbs up with ebert adding theres so much thats fine in this movie 2  while the film had a disappointing domestic box office return of 44619100 it fared much better overseas  taking in an additional 98321000 the movie grossed a worldwide total of 142940100   a two hour version was made to show on television and airline flights by cutting most of the plotline involving hopkins characters business  brest derided this edit of his film and thus disowned it so the directors credit was changed to the hollywood pseudonym alan smithee

this is one of the greatest films ever made if you had to say this film is about revenge  the story line is great  this film is way better the death wish mel gibson was a great actor for this role  the best  part of film is when mad max drives about five insane bikers off a bridge there were two seqels to this film  they are the road warrior and mad max beyond thunderdome but the first one is best  this is truley a cult classic

in a world where we have movies titled cowboys vs  aliens any horror movie takes on comedic overtones  in this case its cowboys vs  molemen but the burrowers is so much more   the movie begins with a flashback to irishman fergus coffey karl geary giving a silver brooch to his betrothed maryanne stewart jocelin donahue  then comes the gut punch of a family abducted by   something  to the directors credit we dont see the somethings until well into the middle of the film   but the burrowers is less interested in the creatures who are interesting but not groundbreaking and prefers instead to focus on the conflict between the american indians and the northern occupational forces  the good guys consist of our coffey former military officer john clay clancy brown investigator william parcher william mapother and brings along the song of the woman hes courting   after tagging along with a military train led by psychopathic captain henry victor doug hutchison they pick up african american cook callaghan sean patrick thomas and decide to venture out on their own in pursuit of the kidnappers   the kidnappers of course arent the indians but ancient beasts that paralyze their prey bury it and then eat them later  they are a byproduct of the war over the buffalo which was their usual prey until the white man drove the buffalo to near extinction  all told the monsters take up twenty minutes of the film   the rest of the story is the unpleasant realities of war between the whites and indians   the whites make no distinction between ute the bad indians and the sioux the good indians  military forces use torture on their indian captives   indians bash the faces in of fallen foes   and no one has any compunction about shooting a mans horse   this isnt the wild west of the movies   by the time the burrowers are revealed its clear that humanity has inflicted far worse on each other  sure the burrowers are disgusting frightening and predatory   but in comparison to the horrors of war theyre the lesser of two evils  the burrowers ends on a nihilistic note a welcome change from typical man vs  monster films  the fate of the protagonists is appropriately awful enough that it burrows into your brain long after the movie is over

now ive had a chance to see this again ill review this again  its is definitley better after a second viewing although i still found it not as good as the first two  i must say on the positive side the costumes sets and effects were second to none  the cg scenes are unbelievable  how did they manage to do all that i wish some of the questions were answered better in this movie but the action scenes alone make up for that  a great series of movies that must surely have  cult  status already

1997s fourth installment in the aliens movie franchise is my least favorite of the bunch for many reasons even though it also has its own merits  in all honesty while theres plenty of things to enjoy this movie is missing something that made the first two movies so incredible and even the third one which has its own flaws of its own  p this movie takes place 200 years after the events of alien 3  ellen ripleys dna has been successfully recovered and a mix of ripley and the aliens dna have been successfully cloned and now ripleys descendant actually a clone of her has been brought to life to wage her final battle against the predatory aliens that are now approaching the planet earth  the new ripley has alien dna within her that makes her capable of caring for the alien creatures  a band of vicious smugglers however comes on board to steal the alien dna only to discover that the new breed of aliens is more dangerous than any other ever before and now the aliens are hunting both ripley and the smugglers and now they must destroy the alien and prevent them from getting to earth and also try to make it home alive  p this movie cuts both ways for me  while certainly not a bad movie overall alien resurrection suffers the most from serious flaws more than any of the previous alien movies  while the movie is enjoyable for its special effects and awesome action sequences i for one agree with many that this was almost not even necessary to be made like this especially since the 1992 third entry was where it shouldve ended  a lot scenes are pretty gross to look at especially the ones where ripley tries to calm down the alien creatures or even tries to act like some mother figure to them  i for one feel that this movie is more of like some alternate timeline movie spin off of some sort that almost feels completely detached from the previous three and that its almost like thrown together leftovers from them as well   p the cast is hit and miss for me  sigourney weaver as the new ellen ripley is fantastic as usual and is the only one in my opinion who really carries this movie all the way through  her character is still very good although a step or two down from the previous movies  the rest of the cast however really dont fare anywhere near as good  winona ryder really drops the ball on this one and the character she plays is boring and without character or personality even though she isnt as she is thought to be  the male cast comes off being excessively dry and unconvincing and one in particular is almost enough to tick you off at his attitude towards ryders character in this movie  the directing by jean pierre jeunet is really good and this combined with siguorney weavers acting as usual really do a lot to make this flawed movie a good movie worth watching  p the movie has its merits though  the special effects are top rate and the movie has a really suspenseful tone but it starts getting to the point that the formula has been a bit tried since it has already been done three times already  the newest species of alien is really scary and but the face and head look almost like a human skull or even a deformed freddy krueger  the movie is saved by a really awesome but gruesome ending which im not going to mention out of fear of spoiling it  the ending alone saves this movie along with the special effects  while many movie series seam to suffer from a pattern called the fourth installment syndromecurse or whatever you call it with examples like batman and robin or jaws the revenge alien resurrection avoids a lot of this with great special effects and awesome sequences  for a part 4 movie this really fares so well for a fourth installment and maintains some freshness even if the cracks in the franchise start showing through  p the directors cut edition of alien resurrection does little to improve this movie and is only like ten minutes longer than the original and of the revamped versions of all of the alien movies alien resurrection benefits the least out of them all and the result is disappointing  the movie also has a new intro to it  the second disc like the other films on their newest re issues has lots of great extras with making of commentaries and lots of cool easter eggs  there are plenty of extras in this movie that are worth looking at though and the dvd is really excellent  the picture quality was good to begin with but this collectors edition really improves the picture quality and the sound quality is amazing to the point that if you have surround audio speakers or can connect your tv to the stereo speakers then it will feel almost like youre back at the big screen again the final result for me is that this gets a rating that rounds off to 3 solid stars but at the same time this movie while good on its own just never can find its own place against the shadows of its predecessors and is ultimately a movie that is more for the die hard alien audiences  p looking back on it now i have to say that despite the weaknesses especially on the last two parts in the series aliens stands as one of the best sci fihorroraction movie franchises of all time and that sigourney weaver may be the most remembered by her roles in all of them

i recently watched the blue ray version of this movie with the expectation of the new horrow classic but unfortunately it was a big disappointment  i hope this is not your introduction to the new horror genre because high tension them may and inside are all far superior than this film french horror is awesome  the movie spent alot of time setting up for the scenes in the cave and had some pointless story before they finally even got to the cave  it seemed like for over half the movie you are sitting there waiting for something to happen  it was so dull luckilly i had my computer and was surfing the net  i also feel that creatures themselves looked like a knock off of a sci fi channel movie  they look like a combination of nosferatu with pirranha teeth   if you see the movie for hot girls you may be happy but dont expect much to get you to excited    i e  no nudity a cardinal sin if hot girls are in horror movies there were some scenes in the cave that were quite intense but not enough  they should have had more scenes concerning the isolation and darkness of the large cave  they also should have created more suspense playing with the emotions of the audience  all the characters seemed to have light moving in the cave through the whole movie and i believe that if some scenes in complete darkness would have been far more effective  overall i feel this is no better than any of those straight to video horror movie

as you probably know the quotwhy we fightquot series was produced by frank capra when he was a major in the u s  army signal corps  the series was commissioned by army chief of staff general george c  marshall as a way of indoctrinating all the troops who signed up in the wake of pearl harbor and the declaration of war  the idea was to make it clear we were doing more than just remembering pearl harbor  eventually the series was shown to the public in theaters across the country  this introductory film in the quotwhy we fightquot series covers the events leading up to the second world war focusing on the rise of fascism in italy and germany the japanese attacks on manchuria and the united states lack of military preparedness  the last is particularly interesting because it implicitly explains pearl harbor not as a japanese victory but rather as an american defeat we lost rather than they won  quotprelude to warquot defines world war ii in black and white terms as the totalitarian worldwide conspiracy threatens to turn the free world into a slave world  admittedly a propaganda film this 1942 documentary is quite informative explaining about hitlers book quotmein kampfquot lebensraum the tanaka plan the london naval treaty the kellogg briand pact the nuremberg laws and even such details as the roman fasces  pthis 54 minute black amp white film won the academy award for best documentary in 1942 and the series as a whole is credited with redefining the documentary as an art form  of great historical value it must be underscored that quotprelude to warquot is not exactly propaganda in the most pejorative sense of the term  the films great quotsinquot along those lines is that it makes the case that public opinion was moving in the direction of joining the war  instead of dismissing this film and capras efforts as the american counterpart to what goebbels was doing in nazi germany it is more accurate to think of it as being the film equivalent of a prosecutors speech in a trial  quotprelude to warquot makes much better use of evidence without the radical distortion you usually find in classic examples of propaganda

going into this film i felt that it already had two strikes against it   it was an extended video game commercial and it clearly had very little to do with the real dante and a hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb001lnow3gthe divine comedya   amazingly enough though the film was still able to win me over with stunning textured animation not computer generated fantastic voice talents and a story and main character that both become surprisingly rich as the story moves forward   i found it incredibly rewarding to watch a simple two dimensional hero come face to face with the accidental sins hed been party to throughout his life and seek redemption and extreme self sacrifice in the process   its exciting shocking and incredibly thoughtful    much more than a shameless video game tie in   it also exhibits a decent understanding of hell as dante portrayed it even though the plot is entirely original   all in all this is a first rate effort and its the kind of anime classic that id be proud to put on the shelf next to a hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproductb00012qlq4akiraa and a hrefhttpwww amazon comgpproduct6304493681ghost in the shella but i must warn parents that this is definitely not a film for kids and adolescents to watch   sex and nudity are excessive throughout whether in portraying half naked corpses naked lovers praying or demon temptresses with highly detailed and weaponized genitalia  im not sure why the animators felt the need to add all of this but as a result dantes inferno is definitely for adults only

if you liked the first two seasons of ghost whisperer you will love season three  the series is taken to a new level literally with fantastic sets and special effects  we also learn about melindas family and how she and jim probably came to live in grandview  the dvd also contains many extras including behind the scenes peeks melindas diary webisodes and interactive games  it makes a great addition to any dvd collection

i was amazed at the acting by elle fanning in this movie   she really does a wonderful job of showing the emotions of a little girl who does not understand what is happening to her or why she is compelled to act the way she does   the supporting cast does a great job as well as her family and drama teacher   i was moved several times during the movie by the portrayal of emotions   great movie

no  seriously   you have to give the halloween franchise its props just because its survived this long   with these periodic help feed moustopha sequels its always hit or miss   everyone agrees the first is a classic and everybody loves the shape charecter so much that they will continue to go back again and again hoping it will be a decent flick   so far halloween 4 is the only one to arguativly measure up while five and six tried to incorporate a storyline which was retarded and thus would have killed the franchise had jamie lee curtis not wanted to do h20   now h20 wasnt a scary move in the least bit but it was a respectable halloween sequel this one   this one was ok not the best but it wasnt horrible its watchable because there are some scares and fans love michael and the halloween theme music   so just be thankful the stupid cult storyline is no where in site and give the franchise some respect for having such loyal fans to be able to put on sequel after hit or miss sequel   and just hope 9 will be better  you know youll go watch it

now i know where isabella rosellini gets her hybrid talent and beauty  i can only say that ingrid bergman is one of the most beautiful faces ever to grace the silver screen and that talent of hers was unsurpassed  a  genuine actress with real talent when hollywood still had morals   in my  opinion the ending is what makes this movie the all time classic that it  is today and unquestionably my favorite pthe movie was very hip for its  day  a scandaluos beloved woman in desperate times   just thinking about  any number of sceens with her and boggie still brings tears to my eyes

the subject matter is all over the place in other reviews and in the description of the movie so no sense in rehashing all that in this review other than to say that the story is utterly compelling   and when i watched the movie i had no idea it was based on a true story  when the end credits rolled and it made mention of the real people i was blown away i cant believe someone exists as amazing as that teacher   but plotline aside you the review reader are more interested in whether the people who put this together pur it together in a way that is actually good   yes they did  acting is topnotch all around  some very brilliant directing with great emotional use of lighting shadows hand held cam and so forth   it feels very real and dips into the pathos of the characters without getting saccharine or sentimental about it or portraying a naive sort of neanderthalism   my only complaint is that the other teacher   i cant remember her name but she was played by the woman who played the bad lady in the order of the phoenix   is one dimensionally nasty  we never see another side of her  while i dont doubt that she was based on a real person i cant believe that anyone is that one dimensional  it seemed a rather cheap trick on the part of the writers and director to make her entire being the bad person without any humanity  this is one of the reasons i have to give this a four star instead of five   the other reasons are minor involving a few slipshod acting moments the occasional uninspired camera shot and so forth   but overall this is definitely a 4 star probably a 4 5 star movie that should go on any movie collectors shelves just for being a well made movie and should be on other peoples shelves for the inspiring beautiful story that it tells   would that all americans were as amazing as erin gruwell

i remember seeing the posters for this one when my buddy and i were hanging out in cali for the weekend of horrors horror con  i cant say i was thrilled at first when i hard the news although i had known it was just a matter of time before some schmuck saw reason to remake yet another cult film fave  i still was hellbent for election on seeing this film and even had hoped that id be able to catch it in the theaters  no such luck  i had to wait for dvd like everyone else but at least walmart sells the standard dvd for 10 so whos complaining right  if youve seen the original you pretty much know what to expect here  if rape or brutality offends you isoyg isnt your movie  no other way to put it  this is not a michael bay film and i thank god for that  the film makers here actually did their homework and delivered a very effective if not powerful revenge flick which holds up well for repeated viewings and should satisfy most horror fans in the midst of things  probability suggests i will grow to like this film even more with repeated viewings as there arent any great horror films that im aware of anymore which are granted a major release   isoyg is as brutal as they come but this is not an eli roth film as we have no sympathy for jennifer hills victims  well maybe one    suffice to say you are rooting for her all the way in the second half of the film as each lowlife is dispatched in the most gruesome fashion imaginable  rest assured she will have no mercy on any of them and will not back down until each one is punished severely   definitely much more polished and professional than the seventies grind house classic the remake still manages to disturb its viewer and doesnt let up  whereas the original focused somewhat on the sexualized violence in our protagonists revenge scheme the modern day classic alleviates seduction altogether  instead jennifer chooses to pit them against each other and takes her time to carry out the methodical revenge plan  although we do not necessarily see how she escapes or her grand scheme of revenge we are fully assured that justice will be served in the most bloody cathartic sense of the word   what i found most disturbing about the revision is how her attackers torment the lead character as if we were watching michael hanekes funny games instead of your typical raperevenge fare  i must confide that watching these men abuse jennifer in every sense of the word before sexually assaulting her really took me out of my element and i couldnt but think of all the innocent women who have been raped through the years  even a more hideous thought theyve been killed after being assaulted   brave sarah butler  this is one role that really deserves the utmost praise and its a shame we dont give oscars for horror flicks very often  camille keaton is an awesome actress and i couldnt imagine anyone who could pull off this role but sarah butler is outstanding as jennifer hills  in fact the supporting actors are very convincing as well which is a strong suit considering most of the cast in the original looked very wooden   thumbs up sky high its hard to tell if the isoyg is really just a fluke or if we can expect more great endeavors from the castcrew but im definitely sold on this effort  as a long time horror fan and lover of films which address the male encroachment issue this is one powerful piece of film making  see it if you handle it

i wanted to like this one  great cast   love uk gangster flicks   intrigued by the improvlack of script but ultimately was not moved by mick rossi   the big names are good but the story fizzles a bit   still its an experiment worthy of watching for students of film

i must confess i was not sure what to make of this movie   first you had downey jr  stepping into the role of the iconic sluth and second well you had downey jr  stepping into the role of sherlock holmes   on some levels it works i mean lets face it downey is fun to watch and he has that quirky quality one must have to play the singular holmes   the real problem with this movie was not downey he was game as always but the screenplay i mean the masons again  i also found it hard to understand some of the dialogue downey spoke quickly and with his mock english accent i had to hit the subtitle on the dvd menu   this being a convaluted mystery it was most important to understand what was being said   the story itself is interesting on some level but no exactly original frankly at times i thought i was watching the league of distinguished gentlemen for the record not a movie i care see again   the villian is well played and to be honest i wish i had seen a bit more of him   oh yes dont let me forget law he was actually quite good as watson and i liked his banter with downey jr   overall not a bad movie downey has potential as sherlock lets just hope in the sequel he gets a screenwriter that can keep up with him
